abstract: HIV in the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to the development of HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND), even with chronic antiretroviral therapy. In order for antiretroviral therapy to be effective in protecting the CNS, these drugs should have the ability to localize in brain areas known to be affected by HIV. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate the localization patterns of three first-line antiretroviral drugs, namely, efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine, in the rat brain. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) were utilized to assess the pharmacokinetics and brain spatial distribution of the three drugs. Each drug was administered (50 mg/kg) to healthy female Sprague–Dawley rats via intraperitoneal administration. LC–MS/MS results showed that all three drugs could be delivered into the brain, although they varied in blood–brain barrier permeability. MALDI-MSI showed a high degree of efavirenz localization across the entire brain, while tenofovir localized mainly in the cortex. Emtricitabine distributed heterogeneously mainly in the thalamus, corpus callosum, and hypothalamus. This study showed that efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine might be a potential drug combination antiretroviral therapy for CNS protection against HAND..

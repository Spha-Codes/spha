abstract: Atherosclerosis remains a leading cause of cardiovascular diseases, driven by lipid accumulation and inflammation within arterial walls. To better understand the spatial organization of lipids in diseased arteries, we applied matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to profile the lipid distribution within carotid plaques. This study aimed to delineate specific lipid species and their localization in regions of interest (ROIs) within the plaque, including lipid cores and fibrous caps. Results revealed distinct lipid signatures corresponding to various stages of atherosclerosis, with certain ceramides and cholesterol esters more prevalent in highly inflamed areas. The spatial lipidomic insights could provide valuable information for targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating lipid metabolism in advanced atherosclerosis.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

In this project, we explore the relationship between lipoprotein (a) levels and plaque vulnerability in cardiovascular health. Driven by curiosity, we investigate how the spatial distribution of lipoprotein (a) influences the stability and risk of atherosclerotic plaques. By analysing medical imaging and clinical data, we aim to uncover patterns that contribute to cardiovascular risk assessment and potential treatment strategies. Through this research, we hope to provide valuable insights into the role of lipoprotein (a) in heart disease and advance our understanding of plaque vulnerability.

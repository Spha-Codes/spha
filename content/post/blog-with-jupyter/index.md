## Project Overview

This project is my personal exploration into the real estate market in Edinburgh. Driven by curiosity, I am analysing property prices to uncover trends and factors that influence market values in different areas of the city. By examining various datasets and using regression models, I aim to predict future prices and share insights through clear visualizations.

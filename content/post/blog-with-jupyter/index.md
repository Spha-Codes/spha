## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiovascular events based on patient clinical and demographic data. By applying machine learning techniques, the project will explore various risk factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, lifestyle habits, and pre-existing medical conditions. The objective is to build a reliable and interpretable model that can estimate the likelihood of cardiovascular events, supporting early intervention and personalised treatment planning.

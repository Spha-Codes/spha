I’m a research scientist at the <span style="color:red">[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)</span>’s BHF Centre for [Cardiovascular Science](https://cardiovascular-science.ed.ac.uk/). I focus on understanding cardiovascular health, specifically heart conditions like [atherosclerosis](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/atherosclerosis) and [aortic valve disease](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/heart-valve-disease). I use advanced techniques like Mass Spectrometry Imaging, [Spatial Omics](https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1G680000008gwKEAQ), Proteomics, and Metabolomics to study disease progression. My goal is to find new biomarkers that could lead to better diagnoses and treatments. 🌿🔬

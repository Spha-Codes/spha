I'm **Spha**, a Research Scientist at the <span style="color:red">[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)</span>, BHF Centre for [Cardiovascular Science](https://cardiovascular-science.ed.ac.uk/). My research and writing explore the complex nature of cardiovascular health. Within this realm, I navigate heart conditions such as [atherosclerosis](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/atherosclerosis) and [aortic valve disease](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/heart-valve-disease), unraveling their mysteries through cutting-edge techniques. My toolkit includes Mass Spectrometry Imaging, [Spatial Omics](https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1G680000008gwKEAQ), Proteomics, and Metabolomics - each providing a lens through which I view into disease progression.

My mission? To uncover hidden biomarkers that hold the promise of more effective diagnoses and treatments. üåøüî¨
